# What is Redshell?

# What do these batch scripts do?
The **_Install_** script will block the Redshell spyware at a Hosts file & Windows Firewall level.

The **_Uninstall_** script will unblock the Redshell spyware. (But why? - see **Warning** below)

# Install
- Right click **1-Install-Block-Redshell.bat** and then click **_run as administrator_.**

*Think in binary - 1 is On*

# Uninstall
- Right click **0-Uninstall-Block-Redshell.bat** and then click **_run as administrator_.**

*Think in binary - 0 is Off*

# Warning
Some games will not launch or work while blocking Redshell, because they unfortunately use this spyware to collect telemetry on **YOU**, so I have included the Uninstall batch script.
