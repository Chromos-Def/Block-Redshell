# What is Redshell?

# What do these batch files do?
Block-Redshell consists of 23 combined hostnames & IPs.

The **_Install_** scripts will block the Redshell spyware at a Hosts file & Windows Firewall level.

The **_Uninstall_** scripts will unblock the Redshell spyware. (But why? - see **Warning** below)

# Install
- Right click **1-Install-Block-Redshell.bat** and then click **_run as administrator_.**
*Think in binary - 1 is On*

# Uninstall
- Right click **0-Uninstall-Block-Redshell.bat** and then click **_run as administrator_.**
*Think in binary - 0 is Off*

# Warning
Some games will not launch or work while blocking Redshell, because they unfortunately use this spyware to collect telemetry on **YOU**, so I have included the Uninstall batch files.
